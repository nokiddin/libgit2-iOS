HOW TO BUILD libgit2-iOS

make fetch

# Set the INCLUDE or CPATH search paths. As we are cross-compiling, we need 
# architecture specific header files. The /usr/include is generally valid only for 
# the current OS architecture and not for the target architecture. In fact, 
# having /usr/include in the INCLUDE path may actually break the build or worse still 
# silently generate an incorrect image. XCode offers platform specific images for many 
# system header files via its SDKs. The $(inherited) already takes care of it. 
# In particular, openssl is not packaged in this SDK and that's why the INCLUDE 
# variable should be used in those limited cases. 

make
...or:
 CONFIGURATION=Debug make  # to restrict only to Debug build.
