HOW TO BUILD libgit2-iOS
------------------------

# 1. Fetch the sources
make fetch

# 2. Manually set the INCLUDE or CPATH search paths, read TECHNOTE below on INCLUDE paths
     or, run the set-env script in THIRDPARTYHOME. The INCLUDE path must find the openssl headers.  

# 3. Build. the default "make" will build both Debug and Release, but it can be controlled with a CONFIGURATION variable.

make
...or:
 CONFIGURATION=Debug make  # to restrict only to Debug build.



# ---- TECHNOTE ----
# As we are cross-compiling, we need 
# architecture specific header files. The /usr/include is generally valid only for 
# the current OS architecture and not for the target architecture. In fact, 
# having /usr/include in the INCLUDE path may actually break the build or worse still 
# silently generate an incorrect image. XCode offers platform specific images for many 
# system header files via its SDKs. The $(inherited) already takes care of it. 
# In particular, openssl is not packaged in this SDK and that's why the INCLUDE 
# variable should be used in those limited cases.
